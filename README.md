# Signus Client
Signus is an **experimental** chatting application built with Kotlin powered by [TornadoFX](https://tornadofx.io/) and [Tinderâ€™s Scarlet](https://github.com/Tinder/Scarlet). It delivers messages through a WebSocket connection and even supports multiple recipients â€” very similar to how a typical messaging app would work.

If youâ€™re interested, the [back-end server is also open source](https://github.com/Masfik/signus-server/).

Current features include:
- Login and register
- Add contacts
- Send and receive messages to/from multiple contacts
- Update your own details

## ðŸš€ How To Run
To compile the app, simply build the project with Gradle and execute the main method as usual. Easy! ðŸ¤œðŸ¤›
