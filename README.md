# Signus Client
Signus is an **experimental** chatting application built with Kotlin powered by [TornadoFX](https://tornadofx.io/) and [Tinder’s Scarlet](https://github.com/Tinder/Scarlet). It delivers messages through a WebSocket connection and even supports multiple recipients — very similar to how a typical messaging app would work.

If you’re interested, the [back-end server is also open source](https://github.com/Masfik/signus-server/).

Current features include:
- Login and register
- Add contacts
- Send and receive messages to/from multiple contacts
- Update your own details
